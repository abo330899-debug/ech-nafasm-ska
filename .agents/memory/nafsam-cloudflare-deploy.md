# Cloudflare Pages deploy (ech-nafasm-ska)

Deploy recipe: build with `CF_PAGES=1 NODE_ENV=production npx vite build` in
`artifacts/nafsam`, copy `dist/public` → `/tmp/nafsam-deploy`, then
`wrangler pages deploy /tmp/nafsam-deploy --project-name=ech-nafasm-ska --branch=main`.

**Token status (fixed 2026-07-13):** `CLOUDFLARE_PAGES_TOKEN` now holds a
working custom API token with Account→Cloudflare Pages:Edit (user re-created it
after two bad pastes — first an old `cfut_` upload token, then a truncated
copy). `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` remains R2-only (no Pages permission).
**How to apply:** before debugging wrangler, test the token directly:
`curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $T" .../pages/projects/ech-nafasm-ska/upload-token`
— HTTP 200 means it can deploy. If it fails, ask the user for a fresh custom
token (Pages:Edit), and warn them `cfut_`-prefixed strings are NOT API tokens.

**Wrangler version:** `wrangler@latest` (v4+) requires Node 22 and the default
shell node is v20 — use `npx wrangler@3 pages deploy ...` (works fine). Pass the
token as `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=$CLOUDFLARE_PAGES_TOKEN` plus
`CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=d2680f7c5ff39f8d9177a51dbf7fec75`.

**/tmp staging vanishes between sessions** — always re-copy
`artifacts/nafsam/dist/public` → `/tmp/nafsam-deploy` in the same command as the
deploy, or wrangler fails with ENOENT.

**Service worker cache:** after any redeploy that must reach returning visitors,
bump `VERSION` in `artifacts/nafsam/public/sw.js` BEFORE building (e.g.
"v6-luxe", 2026-07-13) — the SW serves cached assets cache-first, so without a
bump users keep seeing the old design.

**Run wrangler from /tmp, not the workspace.** From the repo root, wrangler
shells out to git and the sandbox blocks it as a destructive git op; the
blocked attempt leaves a stale `/home/runner/workspace/.git/index.lock` that
makes every later `git commit` fail ("index.lock: File exists") until you
`rm -f` it. `(cd /tmp && wrangler pages deploy ...)` avoids both problems.

**Verify what's live, not what wrangler printed:** after deploy, the main
domain `ech-nafasm-ska.pages.dev` can lag/serve a cached index for ~20s; check
the per-deploy URL first (`https://<id>.ech-nafasm-ska.pages.dev`), then re-poll
the main domain for the new `assets/index-*.js` hash. Deployment history:
`GET /accounts/<acct>/pages/projects/ech-nafasm-ska/deployments` — note that
"latest deployments look recent" may be leftovers from an earlier session, not
proof the current attempt succeeded.
